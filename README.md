# Cake.APT.Module

Cake.APT.Module is a Module for Cake, which extends it with a new `IPackageInstaller` for installing tools using the Advanced Packaging Tool package manager (APT).

APT is a simple and powerful package manager designed to work with DPKG/DEB-based distributions. In particular, APT is the default package manager for Debian, Ubuntu and most other Debian- and Ubuntu-based distributions. This module supports basic package installation, including specific versions, architectures and custom releases.
